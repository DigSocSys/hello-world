# hello-world
The debut repository for my GitHub adventures....

Oh East is East and West is West and ne'er the twain shall meet - 
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgement seat - 
But there be neither East nor West - nor border, nor breed, nor birth - 
When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the Earth.
